## The Tasks

### 1. Task1 - Milani
Complete the method `Task1`, which accepts lists of integers `a` and `b`, and adds up the elements from `a` whose indexes are specified by `b`.  
If any index in `b` is out-of-range for `a`, ignore that index.

### 2. Task2 - Sibahle
Complete the method `Task2`, which removes the first character from every element in a list.  
If an element has no characters, remove it from the output.

### 3. Task3 - Nokubonga
Complete the method `Task3`, which returns `true` only if there are a matching number of `(` and `)` brackets in a string, and those brackets are nested correctly.

### 4. Task4 - Wetsi
Complete the method `Task4`, which accepts lists of integers `a` and `b`, and multiplies the first element of `a` with the last element of `b`, then the second element of `a` with the second-last element of `b`, and so on.  
The resulting list is returned. If lists are different sizes, return `null`.

### 5. Task5 - Ralph
Complete the method `Task5`, which returns `true` if the list is sorted.

### 6. Task6 - Mthabisi
Complete the method `Task6`, which rounds up each number in the provided integer list to the next-highest multiple of 100.  
If a number is already a multiple of 100, it is left unchanged. Do not modify the list that is passed; instead, return a new list.
